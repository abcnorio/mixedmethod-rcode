The R code for DiM_Bretthorst_UMS.r and DiM_Bretthorst_PG.r used the following Mathematica scripts as role models:

- (C) by UM Studer (1998). This Mathematica code is unpublished.
- (C) by P Gregory (2005). You can get the Mathematica notebook on the book's website at https://www.cambridge.org/nl/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-physical-sciences-and-engineering/bayesian-logical-data-analysis-physical-sciences-comparative-approach-mathematica-support

The R code for tweaked versions R functions from DBDA2E-utilities.R and Jags-Ymet-XmetMulti-Mrobust.R is taken from DBDA2E:

- (C) by Kruschke, J. K. (2015). Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, Second Edition: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan. Academic Press / Elsevier. You can get the complete R code freely on the book's website at https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/software-installation

The R code for tweaked/ enhanced and rewritten versions of R functions for exact binomial probabilities share much of the code structure with bayesian2beta.r:

- (C) Sverdlov, Ryeznik & Wu (2015). Exact Bayesian Inference Comparing Binomial Proportions, With Application to Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trials. Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science, Vol 49(1), 163-174. The R code can be downloaded for free from https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2168479014547420/suppl_file/DS_10.1177_2168479014547420.zip
